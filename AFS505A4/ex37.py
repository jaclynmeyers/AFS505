True and False == False

for X in Y: pass also 1 in [1] == True
1 is 1 == True
x = "hello" # this stores textual information
i = 10.389 # floating Numbers
j = [1,2,3,4] # lists
# remember ordinal v cardinal numbers when dealing with lists in code

"%f" % 10.34 == '10.340000'
# floating point real number
"%f" % 435.88 == '435.880000'

2 ** 4 == 16 #power function
2 ** 2 == 4
3 ** 3 == 27

6 == 2 + 4
6 != 2 + 9
# first is equals, second is does not equal
